The grade that we anticipate we would get for this assignment is at least an A-. This is because we spent an incredibly large amount of time on this 
project going through each aspect of the instructions to ensure we met the request of the assignment to the best of our abilities. We are confident that 
we were very thorough, and we often revisited already-written code to ensure it had full functionality. We may have missed a couple things or could have 
been more efficient. Nonetheless, our program executes all of the required functions with their properly functionality and passed the many tests that we 
created for it, such as those in the small programs lettered a through i. While some minor errors are likely present, we believe they are inconsequential.
