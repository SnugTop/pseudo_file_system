The grade that we anticipate we would get for this assignment is an A-. This is because we spent an incredibly large amount of time on this project
going through each aspect of the instructions to ensure we met the request of the assignment to the best of our abilities. We are confident that 
we were very thorough. We may have missed a couple things or could have been more efficient but we believe that our program executes all
of the required functions and passed the many tests that we created for it. It is definitely not perfect, but we believe that we did do a good job 
on this assignment.
